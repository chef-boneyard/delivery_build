# https://gist.github.com/danielsdeleo/b13a7be090905bb97f2d for more
# (The '--no-user-install' bit is key for us currently)
#
# We're inlining the  file content as opposed to using a cookbook_file
# resource here because there were some issues resolving the file; we
# think it has to do with the fact that this cookbook is its own build
# cookbook, and the recursion and inception that results. We can come
# back later and tweak that if we want.

# Customizable .gemrc file (Read the attributes file)
